/*
 * This is an example LinearOpMode that shows how to use a Modern Robotics
 * Color Sensor. It uses the Trainerbot paddle to deploy the sensor, reads
 * the color of a Relic Recovery game piece, and reports.
 *
 * Physical setup:
 *   Put the Trainerbot on a Relic Recovery Field. It's probably best to stay
 * off the Balancing Stone for now; let's keep it simple to begin with.
 *   Put a Platform (black piece of wood with two depressions and a white
 * stripe in the middle) in front of the Trainerbot. Put a Red and a Blue
 * Jewel in the Platform depressions.
 *   Adjust the Trainerbot so its paddle deployed forward would put the color
 * sensor right between the two Jewels. When this opmode runs, the paddle
 * will begin stowed back into the Trainerbot, but will quickly deploy
 * forward to the position you adjusted. That's where it will try to get the
 * color of the left Jewel.
 *   The Modern Robotics color sensor is not very sensitive, so it may help
 * to put it closer to the left Jewel, inside 2cm. Beyond that, it's almost
 * blind.
 *
 *   It is assumed that the color sensor is configured with a name of
 * "colorSensor". That's done in TrainerbotN.xml, of which there are copies in
 * the hardware folder in the root of this project. But the one that counts is
 * the one that rides on the Robot Controller phone.
 *
 * This example is copied from sample SensorMRColor and modified to suit a
 * Trainerbot.
